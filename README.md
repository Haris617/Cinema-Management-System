# Cinema Management System (C++)

**First Semester Project â€“ C++ Console Application**

## Description
This is a console-based Cinema Management System developed in C++.  
It allows users to manage movie ticket bookings, view available seats, select ticket classes, add snacks and 3D glasses, cancel bookings, search for bookings, view revenue reports, and collect customer feedback.

This was my **first-semester project** as part of my Computer Science curriculum.
